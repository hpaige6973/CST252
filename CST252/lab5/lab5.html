  	 <h1>Lab 5:Data Types and Variables</h1>
  	 <p>The purpose of this lab was to start learning basic Java script and about booleans, integers, and strings.</p>
  	 <h2>Challenges</h2>
  	 <p> Personally, I was able to do the lab pretty quickly with some help but I'm nervous about the next lab.</p>
  	 <h3>Results</h3>
  	 <p>I was able to complete the lab with almost no difficulty. </p>
