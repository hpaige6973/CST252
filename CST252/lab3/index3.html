  	 <h1>Lab 3: File structure</h1>
  	 <p>The purpose of this lab was to re-learn how to uplaod our files onto the internet so that everyone can see them. We also reviewed some basic HTML like how to make a list and how to link and image.</p>
  	 <h2>Challenges</h2>
  	 <p> Personally, I had a couple of issues that just needed some reminding. I asked my partner and she was able to help me remember.</p>
  	 <h3>Results</h3>
  	 <p>I was able to complete the lab with almost no difficulty. I also learned how to use the server to upload our files.</p>
