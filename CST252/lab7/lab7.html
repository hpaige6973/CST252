  	 <h1>Lab 7:Functions</h1>
  	 <p>The purpose of this lab was to start learning about functions and what they are used for.</p>
  	 <h2>Challenges</h2>
  	 <p> I had a lot of trouble with the functions because I could not really imagine what their use was. If I can't visualize it, I don't understand it. The conventions all make sense but that's it.</p>
  	 <h3>Results</h3>
  	 <p>I was able to complete the lab, but I think I did the javascript part wrong.</p>
